Example of the removal of contaminating diffraction spikes from a difference image. Each difference image is centered on the location of the contaminating star (left panel), then rotated clockwise by 90 degrees (middle panel). The rotated difference image is then subtracted from the initial difference image, removing most of the flux from the contaminating diffraction spike at the location of the SN Refsdal point sources (right panel).
