\label{fig:SplineFit}
Fitting the SN Refsdal J+H light curves with a spline curve.  The S2, S3 and S4 light curves are shifted in magnitude and time to account for gravitational lensing magnification and time delays, and a 3rd order spline with a single interior knot is fit to the composite S1+S2+S3+S4 light curve.   All four light curves are plotted here after the optimal magnification and time delay shifts have been applied, matching them to the reference light curve of image S1.  The solid curve shows the best-fitting spline curve, with vertical bars marking the location of spline knots:  one "stabilization" knot at each end, and a single interior knot near MJD=57050.
