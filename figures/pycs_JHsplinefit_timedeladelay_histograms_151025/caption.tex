\label{fig:TimeDelayHistograms}
Histograms of time delay measurements from the bootstrap Monte Carlo mock light curve tests.  Time delays are given relative to the reference image, S1, such that a negative time delay means that S1 appeared first.   The mean and 68\% uncertainty range are given in the upper left of each panel, as derived by fitting a normal distribution to each histogram.
