\section{Time Delay Measurement}\label{sec:TimeDelayMeasurement}

Description of the {\tt PyCS} (Python Curve Shifting) code by Malte Tewes for time delay measurement. 

Application of {\tt PyCS} to SN Refsdal: 

 * finding the minimal number of spline knots for accurate representation of the data

 * tests with variation of initial conditions, exclusion of outlier points, removal of the noisy S4 curve

 * booststrap monte carlo simulations to constrain the time delay uncertainty.
